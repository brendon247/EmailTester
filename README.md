# EmailTester

This is a simple Email Verification App. The app prompts the user to enter an email address and once the user click’s on the ‘Verfiy’ button it tells the user whether the entered email address was Valid or Invalid.

The app is built using HTML, CSS & Javascript  in the front end and PHP in the backend. The PHP in the backend calls the Email Hunter API which in turn  is used to verify and validate  the email address. The result of the verification is stored in a file ‘validate.dat’.
